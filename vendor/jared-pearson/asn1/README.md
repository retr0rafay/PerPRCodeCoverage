# ASN.1 Encoding Library

This is a partial implementation of X.690 spec for encoding ASN.1 in PHP. This only contains a
subset of types available in the ASN.1 specification.

This library shouldn't be used and should be replaced by one of the following implementations. The
reason this library exists is due to the amount of time it takes to get approval for third party
libraries.
